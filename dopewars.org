* World
** Days
- Days until game ends
- 1 day = 1 turn
- At end, score is calculated from amount of cash/savings (weapons?)
** Loan shark
- Player starts with a loan at the beginning to be paid off
- Loans are high interest
- Loans give health penalties (broken legs) when too high
- (OPT) Can be accessed from only 1 area
** Bank
- Safe place to deposit cash
- (OPT) Can be accessed from only 1 area
- (OPT) Allow safer loans
** Hospital
- Heal player for money
- (OPT) Only accessible from 1 area
** Weapons
- Buy weapons to defend from cop encounters
- (OPT) This could be extended to more generic "items" which give passives?
** Player
*** Name (string name)
*** Health (list (int current) (int max))
- Can be upgraded/buffed
- (OPT) Player has 2 kidneys that can be stolen and affect health
*** Cash (int current)
- Money on hand, can be stolen/lost/etc
*** Debt (int current)
- Total owed to loan shark
*** Bank balance (int current)
- Money stored in bank is safe, but can't be used without withdrawing
*** Trenchcoat (map (int max slots) (list drugs))
- Drug storage
- Limited space
- Upgradeable
- Drugs can be dumped any time
**** Drug (map)
- ID: maps back to master list
- Price: how much it was bought foreach
- Count: total amount
*** Weapons (list (map weapon))
- Unlimited space(?)
**** Weapon
- ID: maps back to master list
- Ammo: current amount
*** Mules
Needs some thought, might not be good as a separate item.
- Hire mules that allow more trenchcoat space
- Used as health buffers for cop encounters
** Map
- Any area of the map can be travelled to in 1 turn from any other
- Each area triggers random events and has new selection of drugs
- (OPT) Airport area to travel to new maps
- (OPT) Areas/maps could have different preference weights for drug types sold
*** Area
- Name
- (OPT) Area-specific events
** Encounters
*** Cops
- Can fight, run or surrender from cops
- Game over if they kill you
- Simple interface to use weapons
- Mules are killed first
- Surrendering makes you lose all drugs/weapons/cash excluding bank
- Would be good if surrendering with no drugs/weapons has no downside
*** Old lady
- Gives cryptic advice about upcoming events
*** Dealer
- One at every area
- Each visit generates a new set of drugs and prices
- Dealers will only buy drugs they have to sell
- Dealers only sell and buy at their own price
** Events
- Events occur that increase/decrease drug price
- Events are queued globally, not tied to a specific area
- Events occur for giving passive abilities, weapons, drugs, damage
** Drugs
- Drugs have a global base price and max/min price buffer
- Each drug type has a price history for player to view, independent of area
*** Attributes
**** ID (key name)
**** Name
Display name, human readable
**** Base price
**** Upper and lower price?
** Weapons
- Weapons are really simple, have no use besides defending cop encounters
- Fighting also simple, probaby not much past "click button to shoot"
* Turn flow
** Visit area
*** Trigger/process events
**** Granny
**** Cops
**** Busts
**** Random events
**** Weapon shop?
**** Hospital?
*** Spawn dealer
**** Apply event modifiers
*** Talk to dealer
**** Buy/sell interaction
** Visit bank/loan shark
** Manage inventory

* Interface
** Load/save support
This needs to be kept in mind when designing the data structures for everything.
Everything in the world instance must be correctly serialised to an external
file, this means class usage should be kept to a minimum, since classes cannot
be serialised by default and each must have load and save methods written.
Plain lists/dicts/etc can be serialised without modification.
** High score
Stored in an external file, probably binary format to deter someone editing it.
May need to have a set list of game length options, to keep high scores
consistent.
** Name, game length and start map configurable on new game
** GUI library
Dope wars is a game that really benefits from native form widgets since most of
it is dealing with text boxes and tables. Using libraries such as Processing and
SDL is possible, but a lot of time must be spent recreating dialog widgets from
scratch. Following should be considered instead:
- GUI toolkit: Qt still best option, supported on all 3 platforms natively
- Web: Allows native form widgets, but moves app to a hosted solution
** Event log
Separate text box logs all activity and events.
